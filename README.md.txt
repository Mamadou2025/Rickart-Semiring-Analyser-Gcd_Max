Rickart Property Algorithm: A Simple Overview

This program tests certain algebraic properties (i-Rickart and w-Rickart) of semimodules over natural numbers using the GCD operation. It analyzes all possible functions (endomorphisms) on a set M = {0, 1, ..., n}, where n is provided by the user.

Steps Involved:
1. Define the Set: Generate the set M = {0, 1, ..., n}, where n is a user-defined integer.

2. Generate Functions: Identify all possible endomorphisms f of M. These are functions that:
   - Map 0 to 0.
   - Preserve the GCD operation: f(gcd(x, y)) = gcd(f(x), f(y)), for all x, y in M.

3. Check Idempotency: For each function f, determine if it is idempotent, meaning f(f(x)) = f(x).

4. Compute Subtractive Closure: Combine certain valid functions in S to check if their results align with predefined algebraic closure rules.

5. Test i-Rickart Property: Verify if every idempotent function f composes correctly with other functions.

6. Test w-Rickart Property: Check if subtractive closure matches the set of endomorphisms S.

7. Output Results: Report whether the structure satisfies the i-Rickart and/or w-Rickart properties.

How to Use:
- Run the program with different values of n to analyze varying semimodule structures.
- Outputs will indicate whether S, the set of valid endomorphisms, satisfies the required Rickart properties.
